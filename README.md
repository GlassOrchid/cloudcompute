# ☁️ CloudBase

**A developer-centric, transparent, and scalable cloud file backup system powered by Google Cloud and Kubernetes.**

---

##  Abstract

Mainstream cloud storage platforms like Google Drive, Dropbox, and iCloud are highly reliable and user-friendly, but they are designed for general use. For developers, creators, and advanced users seeking **more control, transparency, and flexibility**, these platforms often fall short due to API and commercial limitations.

**CloudBase** aims to bridge this gap by providing a **scalable, secure, and customizable cloud-based file backup system** built on **Google Cloud Engine** and **Kubernetes**. It empowers users to:

- Securely upload and manage files through a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
- Gain real-time insights and analytics into storage usage
- Maintain full transparency on resource usage and system performance

Unlike traditional cloud services, CloudBase provides complete visibility into storage behavior and resource utilization — ideal for users who want to *build upon*, not just *use*, their cloud storage.
